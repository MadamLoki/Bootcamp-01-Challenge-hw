## Horiseon Website Accessibility Optimization

This project involves the optimization and refactoring of the Horiseon Marketing Agency website. The primary goal was to improve the site's accessibility standards, which in turn enhances its search engine optimization. This was achieved by implementing semantic HTML elements, ensuring a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, adding accessible alt attributes to images, and organizing heading attributes sequentially.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```

```
